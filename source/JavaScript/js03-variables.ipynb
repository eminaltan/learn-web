        "**‚ö†Ô∏è The hoisting concept works fully for variables declared with the `var` keyword. A variable declared with `let` or `const` is hoisted but cannot be initialized. This means a variable declared with `let` or `const` is moved to the top of its scope, but it cannot be used before its declaration. If we try to use a variable in the _temporal dead zone_[^6], we encounter a `ReferenceError`. Such variables can be used after their declaration and data storage.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**‚ùó I personally recommend not using the hoisting feature in JavaScript. This is because it sometimes makes it difficult to understand where a particular piece of data comes from. Ideally, declaring a variable and storing its data in the same line is the best practice.**\n",

        "[^1]: The term \"scope\" is used to denote the area where a variable is accessible.\n",
        "[^2]: In JavaScript, a conditional statement allows us to change the flow of a program based on certain conditions or criteria. In such cases, we make use of expressions like `if`, `else`, and `else if`. These are referred to as conditional statements.\n",
        "[^3]: In JavaScript, the content of a variable can be copied to another variable. Generally, this concept forms the basis for the term \"alias.\" Aliases enable us to write understandable and semantic code. For example, in an expression like `let x = 5`; `var aliasVariable = x`;, `x` and `aliasVariable` share the same value. While `x` is referred to as a reference, `aliasVariable` is expressed as an alias.\n",
        "[^4]: I will explain this through a metaphor. In mathematics, we are familiar with the concept of a universal set. Similar to how the universal set encompasses other sets, in JavaScript, the global scope encompasses variables or methods (functions) defined within it and makes them accessible from anywhere in the script. Thus, the global scope can be likened to the universal set in this context. In this sense, they are universal.\n",
        "[^5]: It refers to the variables or other methods (functions) defined within a method (function). Variables inside the function scope cannot be accessed or used from outside; they can only be used within the scope in which they are defined. In this sense, they are considered private or local to that specific scope.\n",
        "[^6]: The concept used for Hoisting is used to express that a variable is unreachable and unusable until it is defined. It remains so until the variable is declared for use.\n"
