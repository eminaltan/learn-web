        "In this section, we covered fundamental topics related to variables in JavaScript. Variables are used for storing data, and there are different ways to declare them. Variables can be declared using the `var`, `let`, and `const` keywords. In modern JavaScript applications, `let` and `const` are generally preferred, but `var` can still be used for older browsers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Among the data types, strings and numeric values play a significant role. String expressions are defined within `\"\"` or `''` and numeric-string values can be used in mathematical operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sometimes, we may want to use a string expression along with a value. In such cases, we can use backticks ` `` ` known as template literals in JavaScript.\n",
        "\n",
        "The concept of block scope emerged with ES6 and the introduction of `let` and `const` keywords. This concept ensures that variables are only accessible within the block where they are defined. Particularly, variables declared with `const` cannot be reassigned.\n",
        "\n",
        "In JavaScript, hoisting refers to the movement of `var` declarations to the top of the code. However, for `let` and `const`, hoisting only moves the declaration to the top without initialization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for developing more complex applications in JavaScript. Knowledge of data types, variable declaration methods, and scope concepts contributes to writing more effective and comprehensible code.\n"

        "[^1]: The term \"scope\" is used to denote the area where a variable is accessible and useable.\n",
        "[^2]: In JavaScript, a conditional statement allows us to change the flow of a program based on certain conditions or criteria. In such cases, we make use of expressions like `if`, `else`, or `else if`. These are referred to as conditional statements.\n",
        "[^3]: In JavaScript, the content of a variable can be copied to another variable. Generally, this concept forms the basis for the term \"alias.\" Aliases enable us to write understandable and semantic code. For example, in an expression like `let x = 5`; `var aliasVariable = x`;, `x` and `aliasVariable` share the same value. While `x` is referred to as a reference, `aliasVariable` is expressed as an alias.\n",
        "[^4]: I will explain this through a metaphor. In mathematics, we are familiar with the concept of a universal set. Similar to how the universal set encompasses other sets, in JavaScript, the global scope encompasses variables or methods (functions) defined within it and makes them accessible from anywhere in the script. Thus, the global scope can be likened to the universal set in this context. In this sense, they are universal.\n",
        "[^5]: It refers to the variables or other methods (functions) defined within a method (function). Variables inside the function scope cannot be accessed or used from outside; they can only be used within the scope in which they are defined. In this sense, they are considered private or local to that specific scope.\n",
        "[^6]: The concept used for Hoisting is used to express that a variable is unreachable and unusable until it is defined. It remains so until the variable is declared for use.\n"
