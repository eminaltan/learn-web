    "**‚ö†Ô∏è Each time a new value is assigned to a constant variable, a new space is allocated in memory to store the data. This can lead to memory-related issues. Therefore, if performance is a priority, we should use constants less frequently.**\n",

    "Variable values are also known as **_variables_**. The assigned value has an address in memory, and the content of the assigned value can be changed. **Therefore, they have the property of being references. In the case of a variable, a new space is not allocated in memory with each data assignment. The relevant reference address where the data is stored is found, and the old data is overwritten with the new data in the reference address.**\n",

    "In JavaScript, primitive data types are fundamental data structures that do not consist of complex structures and directly represent values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primitive data types in JavaScript are used in basic data operations and in representing values, forming the foundational building blocks of programs. They serve as the building blocks for complex objects and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutability:** Primitive data types are immutable once created. That is, once a primitive data type's value is assigned, it cannot be changed. This enhances data security and provides protection against unexpected side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Value Type:** Primitive data types represent the values themselves, meaning values are stored directly in memory. When assigned to other variables, primitive data types are copied, so changes to one variable do not affect others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fixed Size in Memory:** Primitive data types have a fixed memory size. For example, a number is always stored in the same size of memory. This makes them more effective in terms of memory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ease of Use:** Primitive data types are simple and can be used quickly. Operations and comparisons on primitive data types are performed quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Specific Value Ranges:** Each primitive data type represents a specific range of values. For instance, the **_number_** data type, being the most commonly used primitive data type in JavaScript, represents integers and floating-point numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Special Methods:** Primitive data types do not have special methods (functions) or properties, unlike objects and functions. Operations can be directly performed on primitive data types, and there are global functions (e.g., `parseInt`, `parseFloat`, `String`) that can be used for specific operations related to them.\n",

    "\n",
    "In JavaScript, the object data type is a structure used to represent complex and flexible data structures. Objects are data structures containing key-value pairs and play a significant role in JavaScript programming. Objects represent a collection of properties and their assigned values enclosed in curly braces `{}`. **An object can also be created within square brackets `[]`, in which case, the object carries array-like properties.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutable:** Object-typed variables with properties can be accessed in memory, and their contents can be updated. For example, when assigning a new value to an object-typed variable, a new address is not created in memory; instead, the new value overwrites the old one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key-Value Pairs:** JavaScript objects represent key-value pairs. These pairs define the properties and values of the object. Properties (keys) should be of string type, and values can be of any data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic and Extendable:** JavaScript objects are dynamic, meaning you can add, modify, or delete properties (keys) after the object is created. This makes objects flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Properties and Methods:** JavaScript objects can contain both properties (key-value pairs) and methods (functions). Hence, objects can represent both data and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reference Type:** Objects are reference-type data. When you assign an object to another variable, you're actually creating a copy of the reference, and both variables share the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) Compatible:** JavaScript objects support data representation in JSON format. This is commonly used for sharing and exporting data.\n",
