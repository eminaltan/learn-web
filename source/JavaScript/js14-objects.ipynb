    "Before delving into examining objects in JavaScript, I'd like to emphasize the concept of objects in programming. This will make it easier to comprehend objects in JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of programming, we can liken objects to entities in our world. Let's take a car, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, a car is an object in our world. A car has properties such as its brand, model, weight, and color. In addition, there are actions associated with a car, like its operation, braking, or coming to a stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic of objects in programming follows a similar pattern. An object of a certain type has properties and methods (functions) to perform various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, we've seen variables storing only one value. However, a variable of object type can store many properties and methods related to the object. Therefore, the object-oriented programming approach is often preferred.\n"

    "The declaration of a variable of object type is the same as the declaration of a regular variable. The name of a variable of object type is expressed as **_object name_**.\n",

    "\n",
    "The properties inside the object are variables used for storing values.\n",

    "A property consists of a **_key-value_** pair. The **_key_** is used to access the value of the property in the program, and the **_value_** is the stored value within the property.\n",
